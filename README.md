# In My Augmented Reality (AR) mobile app MonoMeta, I've implemented two scripts to enhance the user experience in the virtual gallery. The "ImageTri" script allows users to interact with specific elements, displaying images that reveal hidden objects or provide additional information about paintings. The script controls the visibility of the "customImage" component, showing it when the player enters the collider and hiding it when the player exits. This creates an engaging and interactive gallery experience.

# Additionally, I've used the countdown timer script to switch between different scenes within the app. By loading a new scene when the timer reaches zero, it allows seamless transitions and introduces various levels or sections in the AR experience. This functionality adds a dynamic element and enhances user engagement, offering new content or challenges as they progress through the scenes.
