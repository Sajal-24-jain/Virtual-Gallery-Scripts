# This script is used in Our Augmented Reality (AR) mobile app to trigger the display of an image when a user interacts with a specific part of the app’s interface. It can be used to reveal hidden objects or images, or to reveal additional information about a certain topic. The script works by detecting a user’s interaction with a certain part of the interface, such as a button or link, and then displaying an image associated with the interaction. The script can be customized to include different images for different interactions, allowing for a more customized and engaging user experience.
